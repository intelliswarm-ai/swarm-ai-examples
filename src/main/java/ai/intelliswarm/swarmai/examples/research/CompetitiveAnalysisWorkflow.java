/**
 * Competitive Analysis Workflow Example
 * 
 * This example demonstrates a comprehensive multi-agent workflow for conducting
 * competitive analysis research. It showcases:
 * 
 * 1. Market Research Agent - Gathers market intelligence
 * 2. Data Analyst Agent - Processes and analyzes data
 * 3. Strategy Consultant Agent - Provides strategic insights
 * 4. Report Writer Agent - Creates comprehensive reports
 * 
 * The workflow follows a hierarchical process with a Project Manager agent
 * coordinating the team to analyze competitors in the AI/ML industry.
