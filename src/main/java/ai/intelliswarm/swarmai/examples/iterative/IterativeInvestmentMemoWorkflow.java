/**
 * Iterative Investment Memo Workflow
 *
 * Demonstrates the ITERATIVE process type with a real-world use case:
 * producing an institutional-quality investment memo through iterative refinement.
 *
 * This example showcases:
 *   1. ITERATIVE PROCESS - Tasks execute, get reviewed, receive feedback, and re-execute
 *   2. REVIEWER-DRIVEN QUALITY GATES - A Managing Director agent reviews each iteration
 *      against an explicit rubric and provides specific, actionable feedback
 *   3. FEEDBACK-DRIVEN IMPROVEMENT - Each iteration receives the reviewer's feedback
 *      as additional context, resulting in measurably better output
 *   4. TOOL-AUGMENTED RESEARCH - Agents use WebSearch, SEC filings, and Calculator
 *      tools to ground claims in real data
 *   5. CONFIGURABLE ITERATION LIMITS - maxIterations and qualityCriteria are set
 *      via Swarm config, controlling cost vs. quality tradeoffs
 *
 * Workflow:
 *   ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

 *   └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
 *
 * Why iterative refinement matters here:
 *   - First drafts often miss peer comparisons, misstate risk factors, or
 *     lack supporting data citations. A single pass rarely meets institutional bar.
 *   - The reviewer catches specific gaps ("Section 3 has no peer comparison",
 *     "Risk matrix is missing likelihood ratings") that the writer addresses.
 *   - Each iteration narrows the gap between the draft and the quality standard,
 *     converging toward a publish-ready memo.
